          <p><em>"To hold our tongues when everyone is gossiping, to smile without hostility at people and institutions, to compensate for the shortage of love in the world with more love in small, private matters; to be greater patience, to forgo the cheap revenge obtainable from mockery and criticism: all these are things we can do."</em></p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p><em>"The more you confine a scent the depper it gets."</em></p>

          <br>
          <p><em>"You cannot alter your fate, however, you can rise to meet it if you choose."</em></p>
          <br>   <br>
          <p><em>"We were not made to confine ourselves with numbers and scales. We hold more value in any number will."</em></p>
          <br>   <br>
          <p><em>"No man is evil from birth, just a bad situation. So when you feel hate, angry and do not understand, try to read and think everything in reverse, then everything will make sense; these people, this place, this world".</em></p>
          <br>   <br>
          <p><em>"It's your fate to go there and see what you can see with your eyes unclouded by hate."</em></p>
          <br>   <br>
          <p><em>"I'll be where I need to be when I need to be."</em></p>
          <br>   <br>
          <p><em>"A year from now, you will wish you had started today."</em></p>
          <br>   <br>
          <p><em>"The memory of work disappears like the memory of pain. All anyone remembers are results."</em></p>
          <br>   <br>
          <p><em>"Live by design. Not by default."</em></p>
          <br>   <br>
          <p><em>"Fame is a vapor, popularity an accident, riches take wing, and only character endures."</em></p>
