                What’s interesting about the article “As We May Think” by Vannevar Bush is in the way it expresses ideas that anticipate modern-day inventions and how he had ideas that (almost) accurately describe the future that we live in now. Bush focuses on the concept of extending human memory and its ability to categorize and organize. The text revolves around the device of what Bush calls the “memex” and it is essentially a device that exists in the future where it can “stores all books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility.” (This reminds me of Marshall McLuhan’s theory on “technology as an extension of man”.

                While his invention takes on the resemblance and characteristics of the world wide web, I think creating something that can solve the problem of organizing information and as well as access to such, in turn, increasing the speed at with we can collect and share information is brilliant. However, after reading “Long Live the Web” by Time Berners-Lee, it’s scary to know that something so accessible to our generation can be taken away because of threats from big tech companies that chip away at the fundamentals of the Web for profit.
